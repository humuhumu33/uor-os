            <p>
              Today, data identity depends on location: file paths, database keys, URLs. If you move data, the identity breaks. If two systems store the same information, they have no way of knowing it is the same without a translation layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              This creates a world where data is fragmented by infrastructure. Scientific research stays siloed because data formats are incompatible. Verification of results requires re-running entire experiments because there is no shared reference frame.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prism takes any piece of digital data and assigns it a permanent, unique address based on what that data actually is, not where it is stored.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it like GPS for information. GPS gives every point on Earth a unique coordinate. Prism gives every piece of data a unique coordinate. Two different systems encoding the same value will always produce the same address, independently, without needing to communicate.
            </p>

        content: (
          <>
            <p>
              Prism resolves every value through three independent measurements: the value itself, how many bits are active, and which specific bits are active. When all three are known, there is exactly one point in the system that matches. No ambiguity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every operation Prism performs produces a certificate: a verifiable record of what went in, what came out, and what rule was applied. The same computation always produces the same certificate, regardless of when or where it runs.
