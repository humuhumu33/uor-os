            <p>
              QR codes today are just links. You scan one and hope it takes you where it says it will. There is no way to verify that the content behind the code is authentic, unmodified, or even what it claims to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              This makes QR codes a trust problem. You are scanning a black box and relying on whoever printed it to be honest.

            <p>
              QR Cartridge encodes a content-addressed identity directly into a standard QR code. When scanned, the QR resolves to the content, whether it's a movie, an application, a song, or a website. The identity is derived from the content itself, so the same content always produces the same QR code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of each QR code as a cartridge. Scan the cartridge to load the content. The cartridge doesn't contain the content itself; it contains the content's verified identity. Any resolver on the network can serve the content, and any client can verify it matches. <Link to="/cartridge" className="text-primary hover:underline">Try the generator.</Link>

          <>
            <p>
              Every cartridge carries a dual-layer payload: an HTTP fallback URL that any phone can scan, plus a SHA-256 hash fragment that UOR-aware clients use for full verification. The QR code is ISO/IEC 18004 compliant. No custom extensions, no proprietary formats.
            </p>
            <p>
              Same content always produces the same QR. The hash is the identity. Works with any media type: movies, apps, music, websites, data.
