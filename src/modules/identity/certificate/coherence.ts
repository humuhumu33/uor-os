/**
 * Algebraic Coherence Gate
 * ════════════════════════
 *
 * Binds every UOR certificate to the foundational ring identity:
 *
 *   neg(bnot(x)) ≡ succ(x)   for all x in Z/256Z
 *
 * A witness value x is extracted from the certificate's content hash.
 * The coherence gate verifies that this identity holds, proving the
 * certificate was produced by a mathematically coherent UOR system.
 *
 * This is lightweight (O(1), pure arithmetic) but carries deep meaning:
 * it anchors every certificate to the algebraic substrate that makes
 * the entire UOR framework self-consistent.
