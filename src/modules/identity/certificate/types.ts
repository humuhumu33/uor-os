 * UOR Certificate Types
 * ═════════════════════
 *
 * The certificate is a self-verifying JSON-LD document carrying
 * everything needed for independent verification:
 *
 *   @context             . The JSON-LD context (UOR ontology)
 *   @type                . Always "cert:ModuleCertificate"
 *   cert:subject         . What this certificate is about
 *   cert:cid             . The content identifier (CIDv1)
 *   cert:canonicalPayload. The original content in canonical form
 *   cert:boundary        . Compact boundary (hash + keys)
 *   cert:sourceHash      . SHA-256 of the pre-boundary source object
 *   cert:coherence       . Algebraic coherence witness
 *   store:uorAddress     . Braille visual encoding of the hash
 *   store:ipv6Address    . Routable network address derived from content
 *   cert:computedAt      . When the certificate was last computed
 *   cert:issuedAt        . Immutable birth timestamp
 *   cert:specification   . Version of the certificate format
