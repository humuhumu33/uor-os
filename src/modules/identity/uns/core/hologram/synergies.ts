/**
 * UOR Hologram. Cross-Projection Synergy Engine
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every external standard is a viewing angle of the same UOR identity.
 * But standards don't exist in isolation. they form CHAINS where the
 * output of one projection feeds the input of another. These chains
 * are the connective tissue of global interoperability.
 *
 * This module discovers, verifies, and exposes all cross-projection
 * synergies. proving that one hash, projected through multiple
 * standards, produces a fully interoperable identity mesh.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   SynergyChain  = ordered sequence of projections that compose
 *   SynergyBridge = shared encoding between two projections
 *   SynergyGraph  = the complete interoperability map
 *
 * @module uns/core/hologram/synergies
