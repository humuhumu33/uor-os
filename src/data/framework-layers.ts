      "Everything in UOR rests on a small set of mathematical rules that can be verified by anyone, on any machine, in under a second. The key rule: applying two simple reversible operations in sequence always produces the next value. This single fact guarantees that every possible value is reachable, making the system complete. If the foundation holds, every layer above it is reliable. The UOR Framework defines these rules formally. Prism executes them.",

If two systems hold the same data, they automatically arrive at the same address, with no coordination needed. This means you can always verify that data has not been altered, and you never lose track of what something is, no matter where it moves.",
